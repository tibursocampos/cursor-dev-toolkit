## Decision table

| Principle | Trigger | Threshold | Severity | Exceptions |
|-----------|---------|-----------|----------|------------|
| **DRY** | Repeated code block | 3+ identical or very similar occurrences | Suggestion | Generated code, distinct test scenarios, documented intentional duplication |
| **KISS** | Long method | > 50 lines | Suggestion | Handler with clear sequential steps |
| **KISS** | Excessive abstraction | Factory-of-factory, unnecessary builder | Blocking if code is worse | - |
| **KISS** | Many parameters | > 5 parameters in one method | Suggestion | Unrelated parameters |
| **YAGNI** | Dead code | Type/method/variable never referenced | Blocking | - |
| **YAGNI** | Speculative feature | Field/method without current requirement | Blocking | - |
| **Encapsulation** | Related parameters | 4+ parameters (e.g. address fields) | Suggestion | Unrelated types |
| **Encapsulation** | Over-broad variable scope | Loop variable used only inside loop | Suggestion | - |

## General rules

- **Isolated KISS** is usually suggestion only - unless the change actively worsens readability.
- **YAGNI dead code** is blocking: remove it, do not comment it out.
- **Do not flag generated code:** migrations, scaffolded DTOs, etc.
- **DRY minimum:** 2 occurrences -> no comment; threshold starts at 3.
