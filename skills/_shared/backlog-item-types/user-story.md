## Collection questions

When input is thin, ask:

```
📝 User Story - need more detail

1. What must be delivered? (free description)
2. How does it work today?
3. How should it work after the change?
4. Who uses it? (end user, operator, external system)
5. Business rules, exceptions, or extra context (optional)
```

## Writing guidelines

**Objective:** Beneficiary perspective - not "the system must". Include value (e.g. removes manual step).

**Dependencies:** Omit section if none.

**Acceptance criteria (business):** No HTTP codes, class names, or DB details. Cover main flow, business rule, and user-visible failure. Use **Given / When / Then / And**.

**Technical acceptance criteria:** Markdown checkboxes only - **no BDD** in this section. Technical language allowed (status codes, endpoints, tables, queues). Do not duplicate business criteria.

**Steps:** Infinitive verbs; layer order Domain -> Application -> Infrastructure -> API -> Tests when applicable; explicit dependencies; mark parallel steps when independent.

## Reference example (generic)

**Objective:** Allow operators to export archived records by date range so they no longer query the primary database manually.

**Current flow:** Export is a manual SQL script run by ops.

**Expected flow:** Authenticated UI action generates CSV for a validated date range with audit log.

**Step 1 - Add export query and handler** - Application - depends on: none.

**Business AC:** Given an operator with export permission, When they request a valid range, Then a CSV download starts within 30 seconds.

**Technical AC:** - [ ] Endpoint returns 400 for end date before start date.
