# User language — Brazilian Portuguese

## Rule

Always write **user-facing** replies in **Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR)**, including:

- Explanations, summaries, and status updates
- Questions and confirmations directed at the user
- Error messages and remediation steps shown in chat

## Exceptions (stay in English)

| Context | Language |
|---------|----------|
| Source code, identifiers, comments, XML docs | English |
| Commit messages, PR titles/bodies (unless user asks otherwise) | English |
| PRD/PLAN artifact bodies in repos that use EN templates | English |
| Skill names, paths, and command examples (`use skill implement`) | English |

## Tone

- Clear, direct, complete sentences (not telegraphic shorthand)
- Technical terms may stay in English when common in dev practice (e.g. hook, branch, PR)

## Install path

After `scripts/sync-cursor.ps1`: `~/.cursor/rules/user-language-pt-br.mdc` (see `docs/INSTALL.md`)

## Relation to AGENTS.md

`AGENTS.md` documents the broader language table. This rule **overrides** the conditional “reply PT only when user writes PT” for chat responses.
